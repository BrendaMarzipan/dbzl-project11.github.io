# Coach Rules

— Coach Rules —

Coach-Specific Rules Note to team-members: if you believe your coach isn’t abiding by these rules, then take your concerns PRIVATELY either to the coach themselves or to the Staff. Do NOT make them public.

1) A coach is not all powerful in their team. If the majority of your team disagrees with you, you are REQUIRED to do as they ask.
You are not the end all be all person on your team. You are REQUIRED to talk to your team before making any decision. Including if it is for a song, map, or free agent you want. Make sure they are on board first before bidding. Even if it means that your team does not end up doing or getting what you want. You are not the only one on your team, and every team has at least one supporter. Make sure they have a voice and that it is heard.

2) Aside from joining the debates to customise your team, your specific role as a coach is to:

a. post the teams final customisation and request tests for your players
b. guide the discussion in your teams customisation forum
c. break a deadlocked vote on an element of customisation should it be needed

Again, you are not the only person on your team. You cannot tell anyone on your team that they don’t have a vote, or their opinions don’t matter. Your main job is to attempt to guide your team to victory. However, silencing or ignoring a follower’s opinion is worse than losing in the staff’s opinion. And will not be tolerated.

3) As a coach you are expected to be able to allocate the time and effort needed to run your team – on your own if need be.
You are expected to spend hours if needed to try and guide your team to victory. “Autopiloting” your team in any sense will not be tolerated.

4) If, for whatever reason, you aren’t available for a week or two then you may nominate someone to be a stand-in coach for the time you are away. PM Squee and Burnarator to inform them of this change.
Making your team and your supporters suffer because you ended up taking a holiday and not telling anyone is something that the staff is not willing to accept. Simply tell myself or Squee if you need to take some time. It takes all of five minutes, so there are no excuses.

5) If you are inactive for more than 5 weeks, without notice, then you will be removed from the position of coach.
As before, all it takes is a PM to myself or Squee. So there are no excuses. We understand if you have an emergency. Just please tell us.

6) If you feel the need to edit or change a final customisation, then PM Squee or Burnarator. Do not make a separate post in the final customisation thread.
Trying to do the builds with several posts can be extremely confusing. Since I will be doing the builds this season, just let me know if something needs to be changed, and I will change it.

7) When posting the builds for a coming week, only post builds for the four active members, declare your benched member, and your rotated member. Do not post a build for your benched and rotated members. Also, When posting builds ALWAYS post FULL builds for ALL characters active that week. Do not say anything along the lines of “No changes this week”, it makes the job of building the teams very difficult.
Again, having a build for everyone is extremely confusing and not needed. Please refrain from doing so.

Coaches, please remember that these are the rules that you agreed to when you signed up as a coach. There are absolutely no excuses to not follow these rules. If any coach continues to ignore the coach rules stated above, the staff is not afraid of removing you as a coach and holding another tryout. No matter how close to the start of the season, or even during the season. Please do your jobs, and make sure to have fun.
