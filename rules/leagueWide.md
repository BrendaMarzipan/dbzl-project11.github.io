## League-wide Rules

- Any team with a healing grab rotated in that week is banned from Eternal Life
    - Characters with these moves include:
        - Cell (Only applies to a form where he can gain health from grabs)
    
- Any Super Saiyan may not start above SSJ1. The exceptions are
    - GT Goku (He may start in any form from SSJ3 and below), 
    - SS4 Vegeta (since this is his only option for starting form)

- Any character with a giant form (That has a permanent brick wall) may not start in that giant form. There are no exceptions.

- Any Character with a cutscene ultimate may not have savior in their starting form.  This means any ultimate that does full damage if *any* part of the ultimate hits you.
    - End Goku (base)
    - Goten (SSJ1)
    - Adult Gohan (SSJ1)

- Forms of characters are not considered as separate characters. The exceptions are: 
    - Adult Gohan/Saiyaman. 
        - They have also been modded to be unable to transform into the other.
    - Videl/Saiyawoman 
        - At the moment, they need a free Broly's Ring. This will be rectified once the modding for this is understood.
