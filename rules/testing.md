## Testing

##### Rules

1. Testing is currently an off-season only activity. 

2. All testing will be in the following formats
    - 1v1
        - 2 distinct 1v1 tests with 3 guaranteed rounds (formatted as: 3R 1v1)
        - 3 distinct 1v1 tests with 2 guaranteed rounds (formatted as: 2R 1v1)
        - 1 test with 7 guaranteed rounds (formatted as: 7R 1v1)
    - 2v2
        - 1 test with 3 guaranteed rounds (formatted as: 3R 2v2)
        - 2 single round matches (formatted as: 1R 2v2)
    - 4v4
        - 1 elimination round (formatted as: 1R 4v4)

3. All tests may have a full 7 point build with the following caveats. 

    - Team potara limitations do not apply. For example, in a 4 v4, you can have Dende's Healing on each member of your team.

    - Unless specifically requested, you will be testing on your current home map (at this time, just specify your home map until these have been assigned).
