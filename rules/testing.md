## Testing

##### Rules

1. Testing is currently an off-season only activity. 

2. All testing will be in the following formats
    - 1v1: up to 3 best of 3 matches - or - A single match consisting of 5 rounds.
    - 2v2: A singular best of 3 match - or - Two single elimination matches.
    - 4v4: A singular single elimination match.

3. All tests may have a full 7 point build with the following caveats. 

    - Team potara limitations do not apply. For example, in a 4 v4, you can have Dende's Healing on each member of your team.

    - Unless specifically requested, you will be testing on your current home map (at this time, just specify your home map until these have been assigned).
