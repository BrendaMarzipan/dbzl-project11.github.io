## Player trading

In addition to our drop add window, teams may also initiate direct trades to swap players directly and not have to compete for
characters during drop/add. 

#### Rules

- Teams may only initiate direct swaps, with a limit of 3 teams involved in the trade.
- Only characters may be swapped. Zeni cannot be used as part of a trade at this time.
- Staff will review trades for balance purposes only, as we don't want teams to be OP. 
    - The community has a generally good sense of what might be OP, so it's unlikely staff will need to step in.
