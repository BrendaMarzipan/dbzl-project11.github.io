## Player stat calculator

During the previous era of DBZ League, one of the admins, Burnarator collected a lot of stats for DBZ league and built a tool
to allow teams to figure out how much damage a character can do with a given build. 

While it's still very much a work in progress, the current version can be found [here](https://github.com/dbzl-project11/PlayerCalculator). 

The original (as built by Burnarator) can be found [here](https://github.com/dbzleague/PlayerCalculator) 

#### Known issues
- Does not take Gero/19's charge rate mods into account.
- Some b1 effects/costs are reported to be incorrect.
