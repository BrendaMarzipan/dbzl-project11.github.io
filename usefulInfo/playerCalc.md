## Player stat calculator

During the previous era of DBZ League, one of the admins, Burnarator collected a lot of stats for DBZ league and built a tool
to allow teams to figure out how much damage a character can do with a given build. 

While it's still very much a work in progress, it can be found [here](https://github.com/dbzleague/PlayerCalculator). 

As we need to make changes, we'll fork it so that we can continue to build on the work he did. 

Known issues: 
- this version of the spreadsheet does not include modded damage values.
